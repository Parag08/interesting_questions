Timelapse start at any movement of time you keep taking photos till user exist the goal is the give back a series of 100 photos 
with least gap between photos for example.

lets day user wanted a timelapse consist of 5 photos and    
if user stops at 5 second the photos should have a gap of 1   
if user stops at 10 second the photos should have a gap of 2    
gap should always be optimised to be at minimum.
